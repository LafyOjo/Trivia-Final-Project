## React Native Version (WIP)

A scaffolded React Native app is available in the `react-native-app` directory. It uses Expo and Firebase to demonstrate authentication, Firestore integration, and a simple game loop fetching questions from the OpenTDB API.

Run `npm install` in that folder and then `npm start` to launch the development server.
